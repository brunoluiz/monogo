        **üôè Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report.**

        When filling the ticket, try to give as much detail as you can and as well attach logs/dumps from the application. For that you must add `--log ./log.json --log-level debug` when running `xpdig`.

        Run the program with `--log ./log.json --log-level debug` and post its output here.

        **Be aware it might have domain names since it dumps all crossplane traces when in DEBUG.**
        If it can be a problem (eg, real traces, not dev ones), drop `--log-level debug` and use `--log-level info` instead.
